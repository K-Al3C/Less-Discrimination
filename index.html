    <h1>Less Discrimination</h1>
    <h2>By Kenia Castro</h2>
    <p>This video is about the comments some people around the world have to endure. I am an immigrant and I have been witness of whta people have to go through when they are discriminated because of their race. This video is to motivate people to give more love instead of hate.</p>
